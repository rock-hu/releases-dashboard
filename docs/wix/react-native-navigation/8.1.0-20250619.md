📣 <strong>This major release officially brings support for React Native's new-architecture and React Native <code>v0.77.x</code>!!!</strong> 🥳 🍾 🎉

Important

This release also introduces breaking changes - please read below ⬇️

Breaking changes

React Native

* The only RN version supported officially by this release is 0.77.x with new-architecture fully enabled.
* Support for any older versions / old-architecture has been <em>completely removed</em>, and it won't be available in any future RNNav 8 version (RNNav <code>v7</code> is available for that, instead).

We are working hard to support the newer React Native versions (0.78-0.80). The major work we did in this release gives us the tools and the confidence to increase the development velocity and deliver the upgrades faster ⚡. Nevertheless, we don't have any ETA's. Stay tuned for more updates and reach out on Discord if you think you can help out.

Side Menus

* On iOS, side-menus open in <code>aboveContent</code> mode by default, rather than <code>pushContent</code> (see <a href="https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/releases/tag/7.48.0">v7.48.0</a>). In order to force back the existing behavior (discouraged), specify an <code>openMode</code> explicitly:

       Navigation.mergeOptions(this, {
          sideMenu: {
            left: {
              visible: true,
              openMode: 'pushContent', // Legacy mode to opt-out (discouraged)
            },
          },
        });
