Set log level of PHC dropping an endpoint to debug (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2337692272" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/3098" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/zalando/skipper/pull/3098/hovercard" href="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/pull/3098">#3098</a>)

This is needed not to log too many lines. Moreover, the information

about requests amount could be seen in the metrics, the information

about IPs being mitigated could be get from updateStats logs
