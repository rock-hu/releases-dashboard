Changes

fix flakytest: often we get an off by +/-1 so define an epsilon band (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3747291733" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/3800" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/zalando/skipper/pull/3800/hovercard" href="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/pull/3800">#3800</a>)

fix flakytest: often we get an off by +/-1 so define an epsilon and make
