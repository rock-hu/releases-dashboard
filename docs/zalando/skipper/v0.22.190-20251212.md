Changes

metrics: remove invalid routes deletion (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3699559991" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/3776" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/zalando/skipper/pull/3776/hovercard" href="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/pull/3776">#3776</a>)

When validation is enabled and a new invalid route is created, it gets  

rejected and a metric is emitted. But when the route is later fixed, the  

old metric is not removed. Once the route is fixed, there is no error,  

so the corrected route no longer matches the old metric key.
