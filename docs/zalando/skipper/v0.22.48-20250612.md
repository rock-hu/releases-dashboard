Changes

feat/metrics : add new metrics for measuring skipper latency (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3073817158" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/3506" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/zalando/skipper/pull/3506/hovercard" href="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/pull/3506">#3506</a>)

This change involves adding a new metric to measure the overall skipper

latency of a request. i.e., the time taken by a request in skipper

itself, so this does not include time taken for serving for the response

to client and the time taken for the backend round trip.

skipper latency = serve duration - response duration - backend duration
