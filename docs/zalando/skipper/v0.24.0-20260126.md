security: disable kubernetes external name by default, fixes <a title="CVE-2026-24470" data-hovercard-type="advisory" data-hovercard-url="/advisories/GHSA-mxxc-p822-2hx9/hovercard" href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mxxc-p822-2hx9">CVE-2026-24470</a>

ref: <a title="GHSA-mxxc-p822-2hx9" href="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/security/advisories/GHSA-mxxc-p822-2hx9">GHSA-mxxc-p822-2hx9</a>

This release breaks end-users and library-users that depend on Kubernetes  

Ingress referencing a Kubernetes service type ExternalName.

If you are end-user and depend on the former behavior, you can pass  

<code>-enable-kubernetes-external-names</code> to your deployment.  

If you are library-user and depend on the former behavior, you can pass  

the following option to restore behavior:

    skipper.Run(skipper.Options{
        EnableExternalNames: true,
    })
