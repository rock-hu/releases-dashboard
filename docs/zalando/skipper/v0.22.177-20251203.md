chore: update image versions in k8s manifests (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3666858174" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/3759" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/zalando/skipper/pull/3759/hovercard" href="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/pull/3759">#3759</a>)

v1beta1 is removed from k8s since some time. The  

image version used in manifests are not working  

out of the box anymore. At least v0.14.0 is  

required to adopt to v1beta1 removal.
