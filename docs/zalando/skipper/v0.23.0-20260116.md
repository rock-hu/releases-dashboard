security: disable lua scripting by default (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3822733054" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/3830" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/zalando/skipper/pull/3830/hovercard" href="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/pull/3830">#3830</a>)

ref: <a title="GHSA-cc8m-98fm-rc9g" href="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/security/advisories/GHSA-cc8m-98fm-rc9g">GHSA-cc8m-98fm-rc9g</a>

There is a weakness that can be abused by a default skipper installation  

such that you can read arbitrary files as skipper process. It depends on  

the custom installation and environment if this is actually exploitable  

by untrusted people. Since 2022 we provide a detailed Lua <a href="https://opensource.zalando.com/skipper/reference/scripts/#enable-and-disable-lua-sources" rel="nofollow">config<br>
guide</a>  

such that operators can choose how to use Lua even in less trusted  

environments. For example you can use -lua-sources=file and only  

operators that can provide a file accessible to the skipper process are  

able to reference lua sources and execute provided scripts.

Thanks <a href="https://github.com/b0b0haha">https://github.com/b0b0haha</a> and <a href="https://github.com/moyushui">https://github.com/moyushui</a> providing us a detailed report how to exploit this  

vulnerability that is available by default in skipper versions <v0.23

What do you need to do as library user in order to use the old default from <v0.23

    skipper.Options{
            EnableLua: true,
    }

What do you need to do as binary/container user in order to use the old default from <v0.23

    skipper -enable-lua

Workaround for <v0.23

library users:

    skipper.Options{
            LuaSources: []string{"file"},
    }

binary container users

    skipper -lua-sources=file
