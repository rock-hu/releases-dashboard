proxy: fix timings calculation (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3367400693" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/3603" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/zalando/skipper/pull/3603/hovercard" href="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/pull/3603">#3603</a>)

Refactored proxy timing measurement to track request and response phases  

separately.

The previous implementation used a single stopwatch that failed to  

properly handle shunt and loopback scenarios. For loopback routes,  

the entire duration of subsequent loopbacks was incorrectly attributed  

to response time since each loopback creates its own context.  

Additionally, shunt routes never triggered the request-to-response  

timer transition, which was located in makeBackendRequest and  

therefore unreachable for shunt routes.

Additonally fixing another bug:  

The defer statement for finishing the loopSpan was causing response  

filter processing time to be incorrectly included in the loopback span  

timings. This change moves the loopSpan.Finish() calls to execute  

immediately after the recursive do() call completes.
