Changes

Copy backend headers during protocol upgrade attempt (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3039876750" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/3491" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/zalando/skipper/pull/3491/hovercard" href="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/pull/3491">#3491</a>)

When a backend server responded with a non-101 status code during  

WebSocket upgrade attempts, the response headers were not forwarded to  

the client. This fix ensures all headers from the backend response are  

copied to the client response before writing the status code.
