Changes

proxy/tracing: loopback spans bugfix (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3203012301" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/3544" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/zalando/skipper/pull/3544/hovercard" href="https://github.com/zalando/skipper/pull/3544">#3544</a>)

When a request is looped back, all tracing operations (such as tagging

and creating new spans) are performed on the original request's span

rather than on the loopback span. This results in inaccurate tracing

data: tags are overwritten, and the ingress span incorrectly appears to

have child spans that actually belong to the inner loopback spans.

This PR adds a test case to illustrate the issue, along with a bug fix.
