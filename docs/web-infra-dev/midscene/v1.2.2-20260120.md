New Zhipu AI Open-Source Model Support

Zhipu GLM-V Vision Model

* Zhipu GLM-V series models are open-source vision models launched by Zhipu AI, available in multiple parameter versions, supporting both cloud deployment and local deployment.

File upload feature

File upload is a common requirement in Web automation scenarios. v1.2 adds file upload capability for the web, supporting natural language operations for file input boxes, making form automation more complete.

Cache mechanism optimization

Fixed the issue where cache wasn't updated after DOM changes. When page DOM changes cause cache validation to fail, the system now automatically updates the cache, avoiding operation failures due to stale cache and improving automation script stability.

Report and Playground improvements

Deep thinking tag optimization

* Fixed the issue where deepThink tags weren't displayed correctly in reports when using <code>.aiAct()</code> method with deep thinking. Now you can clearly see which operations used deep thinking capability in reports
* Improved the style of summary rows in reports for better readability

Playground stability improvements

* Fixed the issue where Playground didn't properly create agent instances in <code>getActionSpace</code> when using agentFactory mode, ensuring normal operation across various usage modes
* Optimized Playground output display to prevent overly long reportHTML content from affecting the interface

Model configuration updates

Updated configuration parameters for Qwen model's deep thinking functionality to ensure compatibility with the latest model version.
