## changes
* Added support for custom preview annotations (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1581257519" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase/issues/303" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/airbnb/Showkase/pull/303/hovercard" href="https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase/pull/303">#303</a>).

You can now create another annotation class that's annotated with <code>@Preview</code> and Showkase will ensure that the <code>@Preview</code> properties are applied whenever you use the custom annotation. Here's an example

    @Preview(name = "Custom Preview One First", group = "Custom Previews")
    @Preview(name = "Custom Preview One Second", group = "Custom Previews")
    annotation class MyCustomPreview

    // This custom annotation can now be used to represent previews
    @MyCustomPreview
    @Composable
    fun CustomAnnotationPreview() {
    }

This was contributed by <a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/oas004/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/oas004">@oas004</a> and required a lot of diligence üëèüèª

* <strong>Experimental</strong> Added a new artifact <code>showkase-screenshot-testing-paparazzi</code> that provides a mechanism to automate screenshot testing for your codebase using Showkase + Paparazzi (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1510202810" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase/issues/294" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/airbnb/Showkase/pull/294/hovercard" href="https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase/pull/294">#294</a>).

Assuming that you were already using Showkase, you just need 3 lines of code in the <code>test</code> sourceset of your root module to automatically screenshot test all your previews in the default configuration.

    @ShowkaseScreenshot(rootShowkaseClass = YourShowkaseRootModuleClass::class)
    abstract class MyPaparazziShowkaseScreenshotTest: PaparazziShowkaseScreenshotTest {
        companion object: PaparazziShowkaseScreenshotTest.CompanionObject
    }

In our own usage, we've found issues with using Paparazzi when the codebase has a large number of screenshot and haven't quite figured out what's causing it (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1446109760" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/cashapp/paparazzi/issues/630" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/cashapp/paparazzi/issues/630/hovercard" href="https://github.com/cashapp/paparazzi/issues/630">cashapp/paparazzi#630</a>). As a result, try at your own risk. Having said that, we are really keen on resolving the linked issue and deploying this. If you have any insights about this issue, please reach out!
