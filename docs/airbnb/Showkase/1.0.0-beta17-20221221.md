## release on 20221221
## description
## changes
* Optimized the code generation to be more performant (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1493463832" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase/issues/284" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/airbnb/Showkase/pull/284/hovercard" href="https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase/pull/284">#284</a>)
  * We hit an issue with Jacoco that pointed out how our final generated aggregator class had a heavy init method that caused a Jacoco task to fail at scale (1000+ previews). In addition, the root module can become a build time bottleneck as the codebase scales. In this release, we optimized the code generation by moving some of the code generation to the respective modules that have the previews as opposed to generating everything in the root module. This also allows us to leverage incremental compilation better. <strong>One nice side effect of this refactor is that your preview functions are now allowed to be <code>internal</code> instead of forcing you to be <code>public</code></strong>. Please file issues if you notice any weird behavior after this refactor.
* Let the IDE recognize generated code when using KSP (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1464493618" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase/issues/279" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/airbnb/Showkase/pull/279/hovercard" href="https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase/pull/279">#279</a> )
  * Some folks complained how the generated classes/methods weren't being detected by the IDE. This happens because the source generated by ksp specifically needs to be registered separately. The linked PR does it for the sample app and shows how you'd do that in your own codebase.
* Fixed bug in getShowkaseMetadataFromPreview where the preview width was being set as the showkase metadata height (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1468942401" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase/issues/280" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/airbnb/Showkase/pull/280/hovercard" href="https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase/pull/280">#280</a>)

Note: We discovered a bug in the <code>1.0.0-beta16</code> release hence not going to publish the release notes for it. Please use the <code>1.0.0-beta17</code> release instead.
