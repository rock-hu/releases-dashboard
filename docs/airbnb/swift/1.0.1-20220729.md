# 1.0.1

## release on 20220729

## description

## changes

* The package plugin now uses precompiled binary dependencies for SwiftFormat and SwiftLint instead of compiling them from source. This resolves an issue where SPM would reject <code>.package(url: "https://github.com/airbnb/swift", from: "1.0.0")</code> as invalid.
* The package plugin now automatically infers the package Swift version from the <code>// swift-tools-version</code> comment in your <code>Package.swift</code> file. You can customize this by calling the plugin with a <code>--swift-version</code> argument.
* Added <code>XcodeCommandPlugin</code> to support using the package plugin in Xcode 14 project workspaces
