# v1.44.1

## release on 20251015
## description
## changes
This release fixes the following issues:

* Default values for global font color, weight, size, and family are now set in <code>@backstage/ui/css/styles.css</code>, in particular fixing font colors in some parts of the app in dark mode.
* Dev apps created with <code>@backstage/dev-utils</code> now include the CSS from <code>@backstage/ui/css/styles.css</code> by default.
* The user settings plugin no longer overrides the storage API in the new frontend system by default. This fixes an issue where the Signals plugin was suddenly required.
