## changes
This release fixes the following issues:

* Due to an accidental removal of a deprecated NestedValue helper in a minor library update, this change re-exports the type to prevent premature e2e tests breakage until the library is fully upgraded.

* There were two conflicting catalog service references that expected different implementation types, meaning they could not be used interchangeably. To fix this, we are now using a different ID for the deprecated alpha version of the catalog service ref.
