# v1.42.4

## release on 20250826
## description
## changes
This release fixes an issue in <code>@backstage/cli</code> that caused conflicts with detected modules in workspaces containing multiple apps. It also fixes the <code>new-frontend-plugin</code> template, which was incorrectly passing <code>id</code> instead of <code>pluginId</code>  

to <code>createFrontendPlugin</code>.

Additionally, the <code>@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-explore</code> module has been marked as deprecated in favor of <code>@backstage-community/plugin-search-backend-module-explore</code>.
